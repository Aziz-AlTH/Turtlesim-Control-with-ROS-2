# Turtlesim-Control-with-ROS-2
This project demonstrates how to manipulate the [turtlesim](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/tree/ros2/turtlesim) package in **ROS 2** using a custom Python node that sends velocity commands to the turtle.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- ROS 2 (Foxy, Humble, etc.)
- `turtlesim` package
- Python 3 environment

### 1. Source ROS 2 Workspace

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

#### 2. Run turtlesim node 
```
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

```
![ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node](https://github.com/Aziz-AlTH/Turtlesim-Control-with-ROS-2/blob/main/Screenshot-1%20from%202025-08-04%2007-15-51.png)

#### 3. Run the controller node 
```
python3 move_turtle.py

```

#  üõ†Ô∏è Advanced ROS 2 Features
#### Spawn a new turtle:
```
ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn "{x: 5.0, y: 5.0, theta: 0.0, name: 'turtle2'}"

```

#### Kill a turtle:
```
ros2 service call /kill turtlesim/srv/Kill "{name: 'turtle1'}"
```
